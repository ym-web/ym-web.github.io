    <title>Exploring Manufacturing of the United States</title>

<body>
    <h2>We are going to exploring the manufacturing of the United States on this site.</h2>
    <p>Manufacturing is one of the most essential parts of our economy. Manufacturing does not only provide jobs
    for millions of people but also plays a vital role in affecting the global competitiveness of a country. The United
    States had become the largest manufacturing power in the world since the end of the Great War. For more than
    a half century, the United States had been a super power that provided other countries products ranging from commercial airplane
    to microelectronic chips. </p>
    <p>The golden age of manufacturing in the States is at its end, however. The economical growth of the States has
    increasingly relied on service related sections and the output of the manufacturing related sections has been
    stagnating over years. We will explore this worrisome trend from <span style = "color:red"><em>three</em></span>
    different perspectives. Readers can click into the links below:</p>
